# **Finals Task 1** **Events Management DB**
## Create Database:
### We first create the database event_db if it doesn't already exist. Create events_tbl: This table holds events with an event_id as the primary key and event_name.

## Create attendees_tbl:
### This table holds attendees with an attendee_id as the primary key and attendee_name.

## Create events_attendees_tbl:
### This table links events_tbl and attendees_tbl using a many-to-many relationship.

**It uses event_id and attendee_id as foreign keys.**

## Create event_sponsors_tbl:
### This table links sponsors to events with the event_id and sponsor_name.
